              <p><b>ABOUT</b><br><br>19/07/22&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Cubed!&nbsp;Cubed is a personal project of mine to discover eco-friendly alternatives to common building materials!<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>Ever ask yourself: Why don't we use 'insert material name here' to manufacture 'insert construction item/unit/component name here'?
                  Well I certainly do. And one doesn't have to dig too deep to discover that you are not alone. There is a significant body of research on this topic, particularly the application of waste products within common construction units.<br><br>This is ultimately the purpose of Cubed, to explore these 
                  possibilities with the intention of creating ... yep, you guessed it, cubes (well, blocks actually) capable of having real world application in the modern construction and engineering context. This section of the webpage serves as a blog of sorts, with some brief updates on whats happening with Cubed. Below you will find sections pertaining
              to my scientific research as well as documented progress with graphics, images, videos etc etc. At the same time, this page is built entirely with my newly learnt web-development skills. Win-win right?<br><br>Wrong.<br><br>Win-win-win (The Office fans will get it), you also win because you get to see the synthesis and evolution of Cubed. 
              <br><br>20/07/22&nbsp;&nbsp;So having considered some of the major areas of concern in modern construction, as well as the remarkable surplus of waste materials readily available for free, I settled on the first generation of 'green' cement mortar blocks as Spent Coffee Grind (SCG) hybrids. With a thriving coffee culture in Cape Town, I will have to consider establishing relationships with 
            small cafes in order to get a consistent supply of Spent Coffee Grinds. Adding to this thought, the potential to have branded bins for collecting grinds would improve efficiency of collection and delivery to the workshop.</span></p>

              <p><b>SCIENCE-Y STUFF</b><br><br>20/07/22&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief dive into the subject has revealed the use of several common waste products as aggregate in concrete.<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"><br><br>Before delving into these waste items, lets just consider concrete for a second. Concretes raw ingredients consist of a binder (typically Portland Cement), Aggregate (Fine aggregate along with Coarse Aggregate) and water (excluding air content).
                Now these ingredients have evolved with time and the ratios and methodology of concrete creation is very specifically followed to reach desired hardened state properties. It isn't always possible to alter the mix design of the raw ingredients due to tight specification parameters and these scenarios are none of our concern.(unless you can improve on Portland Cements Mechanical properties...) What is our concern is the application of heavy handed mix design (unlikely due to cost), careless disregard for sustainable alternatives,
                  and perhaps a lack of access, awareness or desire to employ cleaner raw ingredients. With that being said, lets take a look at the different ways these cleaner raw ingredients are available to us. These waste products include crushed glass, plastics, polystyrene pellets, hemp and even coffee grinds! (This list is not exhaustive!). This is not to be confused with the common supplementary cementitious materials used in concrete mix design, 
                namely Fly Ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag, Silica Fume and the likes. These supplementary cementing compounds, whilst useful eco-friendly additions to your concrete mix design, are active ingredients alongside the cement quantity in mix design. <br><br>
              Contrary to this, we have our common waste products who's behaviours are more akin to the inert ingredients in concrete, those being fine and course aggregates.<br><br>This is why the addition of something like coffee grinds is a rather delicate procedure. The addition of an inert fine aggregate, with differnt individual material property not alike that of typical fine aggregate builders river sand, means there is a 
              shifting of mechanical properties in these 'green' counterparts, and this shift is not necessarily for the best! The roles of these aggregates certainly needs to be investigated further, but from my brief understanding it is the action of retraint, dimensional stability and interlocking that is sought after from aggregates.</span></p>

              <p><b>PROGRESS</b><br><br>20/07/2022&nbsp;&nbsp;The current short term plan is to conduct research whilst developing a concept for a reusable mould.<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"><br><br>Having previously worked with cement mortar pots I know how important a mould it. Why? Well the first challenge is creating a mould that is exactly to specification, has physical integrity to contain the cement mixture without leak or rupture whilst allowing convenient release and repetitive use.<br><br>
              SO my first instinct is to 1) take a cement mortar block, 2) wrap it in cling wrap (I know, just hear me out), 3) build a timber frame that encloses the blocks faces and base, 4) fix steel anchors to the inside face of the timber frame (visible due to cement block voids), 5) fix steel handles to the outside of the timber frame, 6) Thoroughly oil the cling-wrapped blocks inner faces and timber base, and finally 7) cast cement mortar (perhaps concrete rather... to be discussed) inside the 
            voids of the cement block. Now if you've managed to follow all of that, what we have done (or hopefully done) is create a timber-cement/concrete hybrid mould. The cling wrapped block, now sitting inside our timber frame, with cement/concrete in its voids, will be released to reveal... A cement block mould. We have contained the block perimeter with timber, and created a negative space copy by casting in the blocks voids.<br><br>The biggest foreseable risk is that the internal voids,
          supposedly produced by our negative space cement mortar, may not want to remain in place in the timber frame. I suspect, even with steel anchors, there will be issues with integrity at this interface. SO the alternative, upon failure, is to scrap the entire 'cast something in the void to create a mould' and instead just make a bloody timber negative space.</span></p>

              <p><b>ABOUT</b><br><br><b>19/07/22</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Cubed!&nbsp;Cubed is a personal project of mine to discover eco-friendly alternatives to common building materials!<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>Ever ask yourself: Why don't we use 'insert material name here' to manufacture 'insert construction item/unit/component name here'?
                  Well I certainly do. And one doesn't have to dig too deep to discover that you are not alone. There is a significant body of research on this topic, particularly the application of waste products within common construction units.<br><br>This is ultimately the purpose of Cubed, to explore these 
                  possibilities with the intention of creating ... yep, you guessed it, cubes (well, blocks actually) capable of having real world application in the modern construction and engineering context. DISCLAIMER : I am not an engineer. In fact I am looking for an engineer. A lot of the information is a mixture self taught and research. IF I am misguided and you happen to be an engineer please do contact me. This section of the webpage serves as a blog of sorts, with some brief updates on whats happening with Cubed. Below you will find sections pertaining
              to my scientific research as well as documented progress with graphics, images, videos etc etc. At the same time, this page is built entirely with my newly learnt web-development skills. Win-win right?<br><br>Wrong.<br><br>Win-win-win (The Office fans will get it), you also win because you get to see the synthesis and evolution of Cubed. 
              <br><br><b>20/07/22</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;So having considered some of the major areas of concern in modern construction, as well as the remarkable surplus of waste materials readily available for free, I settled on the first generation of 'green' cement mortar blocks as Spent Coffee Grind (SCG) hybrids. With a thriving coffee culture in Cape Town, I will have to consider establishing relationships with 
            small cafes in order to get a consistent supply of Spent Coffee Grinds. Adding to this thought, the potential to have branded bins for collecting grinds would improve efficiency of collection and delivery to the workshop.

          <b>22/07/22</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I have realised the stakes are not high enough, literally. So let's up the stakes. I have decided to take this idea, of green hybrid components, to build a shed entirely out of Green Cubed products. Now we're talking. 
<br><br>This endeavor now includes prototyping a lightweight reinforced concrete precast panel to span the roof covering, as well as looking into some alternatives to traditional mortar mixtures. In this way we are tackling transverse loading of blocks under gravitational self weight and imposed loads from the roof covering and winds. The roof covering itself will experience bending moments, which I am going to limit by minimizing the spans to 2 meters. I stand corrected but the roof will also be subjected to negative pressures during high winds? (Maybe this is just analysis paralysis) This of course means the furthest span is from corner to corner, being slightly longer than 2 meters, and the entire roof structure behaving like a supported floor slab. The maximum shear experienced will be at its supporting edges, so I expect additional reinforcement in these areas. This would be . As previously discussed, this is where a lighter self-weight is advantageous, which can be taken further by turning it into hollow core (at an increased risk of failure... I think it might be pushing things a bit too far). What we could do is create lightweight blocks for the purpose of a rib-and-block roof design, with the ribs being original recipe reinforced concrete blocks. But more on this after we tackle the block situation!

              <p><b>SCIENCE-Y STUFF</b><br><br><b>20/07/22</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief dive into the subject has revealed the use of several common waste products as aggregate in concrete.<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"><br><br>Before delving into these waste items, lets just consider concrete for a second. Concretes raw ingredients consist of a binder (typically Portland Cement), Aggregate (Fine aggregate along with Coarse Aggregate) and water (excluding air content).
                Now these ingredients have evolved with time and the ratios and methodology of concrete creation is very specifically followed to reach desired hardened state properties. It isn't always possible to alter the mix design of the raw ingredients due to tight specification parameters and these scenarios are none of our concern.(unless you can improve on Portland Cements Mechanical properties...) What is our concern is the application of heavy handed mix design (unlikely due to cost), careless disregard for sustainable alternatives,
                  and perhaps a lack of access, awareness or desire to employ cleaner raw ingredients. With that being said, lets take a look at the different ways these cleaner raw ingredients are available to us. These waste products include crushed glass, plastics, polystyrene pellets, hemp and even coffee grinds! (This list is not exhaustive!). This is not to be confused with the common supplementary cementitious materials used in concrete mix design, 
                namely Fly Ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag, Silica Fume and the likes. These supplementary cementing compounds, whilst useful eco-friendly additions to your concrete mix design, are active ingredients alongside the cement quantity in mix design. <br><br>
              Contrary to this, we have our common waste products who's behaviours are more akin to the inert ingredients in concrete, those being fine and course aggregates.<br><br>This is why the addition of something like coffee grinds is a rather delicate procedure. The addition of an inert fine aggregate, with different individual material property not alike that of typical fine aggregate builders river sand, means there is a 
              shifting of mechanical properties in these 'green' counterparts, and this shift is not necessarily for the best! The roles of these aggregates certainly needs to be investigated further, but from my brief understanding it is the action of retraint, dimensional stability and interlocking that is sought after from aggregates.
              <br><br><b>21/07/22</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit more on the substitution of Spent Coffee Grinds in place of sand:&nbsp;The first thing to note is that the Earth is actually running out of sand. I know, HOW. It is the second most used resource in the world, behind water. Perhaps most alarming, is that concrete makes use of both of these ingredients. I will leave you to research more on this topic, I'm not particularly interested in studying sand. All we need to know is concrete and cementitious products make use of a finite resource, one that needs replacing. Along with these finite resources, Portland Cement is another conversation altogether, with a some scary energy inputs required to produce the ingredient. SO it stands to reason that a substitution of the raw materials, with another material that is otherwise a wasted resource, is a double edged sword in the sustainability world. 
              In expanding on our ingredient, sand, I would like to outline its properties. Sand offers an inert, angular and free from organic compounds, a good sand offers good binding and interlocking properties which increases the surface area available for Portland cement to take effect.Consider Coffee grinds, and you will notice a) it is not angular, b) it IS organic, and c) I'm not entirely convinced it is inert. With this there are some obvious negative mechanical characteristics of Spent Coffee Grinds that make them responsible for the loss of strength in cementitious components. The first is that coffee grinds possess a lower density than the sand it is replacing, which ultimately contributes to an increased porosity and lower density of 'cementitious-coffee components'. At the same time, the lower density has been proven to offer increased thermal and acoustic insulation, something that is 
              commonly seen in other lightweight concrete products. This is because the lower density is caused by air pockets within the coffee grinds, which in turn means more entrapped air within the cementitious mixture. In a nutshell (A hollow, air filled nutshell), this entrapped air acts as a buffer between molecular vibration during the transfer of energy, in this case in the form of heat and sound. In high density materials, molecules are tightly packed together and readily bump into neighbouring molecules, triggering all sorts of chaos (and energy transfer) umongst themselves. Until they encounter empty space (well not really empty, but less dense!), which offers a bit of distance between the rowdy molecules so as to reduce their collisions with each other. 
              <br><br>The lower density also means the components have a reduced self-weight, which is an interesting concept to consider... 
              Consider 2 components. One component may be may be stronger in compression, but have an increased self weight, thus to some degree negating the strength advantage. The other component may be weaker in compression, with a reduced self-weight, and so performs comparatively better than expected alongside its heavyweight counter-part. Now I'm sure there is a lot more to this and I suggest we all do some more reasearch! But I assume the application of lightweight concrete, for example, really shines in situations of a) gravitational self-weight (more a reflection of compressive strength) without additional imposed loading and b) long spans (more a reflection of bending strength) without imposed loading. I also suspect lightweight concrete would outperform traditional concrete if we 
              ever plan to build a staircase to Mars (Somebody please let Elon know in case he decides to save (or lose?&#129300;) some money on rockets and build a staircase)<br><br>
              From the above, I think we can summise that the use of Spent Coffee Grinds in replacement of sand will push our 'eco cubes/blocks/components' towards material behaviour similar to lightweight concrete. Which begs the question, does the application stop at cement blocks? To be continued.

              <p><b>PROGRESS</b><br><br><b>20/07/2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The current short term plan is to conduct research whilst developing a concept for a reusable mould.<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"><br><br>Having previously worked with cement mortar pots I know how important a mould it. Why? Well the first challenge is creating a mould that is exactly to specification, has physical integrity to contain the cement mixture without leak or rupture whilst allowing convenient release and repetitive use.<br><br>
              SO my first instinct is to 1) take a cement mortar block, 2) wrap it in cling wrap (I know, just hear me out), 3) build a timber frame that encloses the blocks faces and base, 4) fix steel anchors to the inside face of the timber frame (visible due to cement block voids), 5) fix steel handles to the outside of the timber frame, 6) Thoroughly oil the cling-wrapped blocks inner faces and timber base, and finally 7) cast cement mortar (perhaps concrete rather... to be discussed) inside the 
            voids of the cement block. Now if you've managed to follow all of that, what we have done (or hopefully done) is create a timber-cement/concrete hybrid mould. The cling wrapped block, now sitting inside our timber frame, with cement/concrete in its voids, will be released to reveal... A cement block mould. We have contained the block perimeter with timber, and created a negative space copy by casting in the blocks voids.<br><br>The biggest foreseable risk is that the internal voids,
          supposedly produced by our negative space cement mortar, may not want to remain in place in the timber frame. I suspect, even with steel anchors, there will be issues with integrity at this interface. SO the alternative, upon failure, is to scrap the entire 'cast something in the void to create a mould' and instead just make a bloody timber negative space.
          
          <br><br><b>21/07/2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I'm be gathering data on cement block design, specifically what the current a) dimensions are, b) the mix design, c) the parameters of cement block manufacturing process (mixing and curing). So far I've come up with the following testing contraints based on several variables. There is existing variability in the traditional raw materials of cement, sand and water. Along with this, we are introducing an added variability by adding Spent Coffee Grinds, namely in terms of a) their source and composition and b) their moisture content (after drying). 
          If you're smart, you might say "Hey Anthony, relax about the moisture content, you're going to throw it into your mix design and add water in any case", but the issue boils down to how much coffee grinds you are getting per volume (or weight). This speaks to a commonly overlooked (or simply ignored) factor present in on-site hand mixing. The quantities of raw ingredients are affected by bulking and shrinkage, or the increase and decrease of volume (and weight) due to fluctuating moisture content. Ordinarily, I would say it can be ignored for less critical works, but when it comes to establishing 
          a precident, we need to know exactly how much of a sample of Spent Coffee Grinds is actually Coffee Grinds. If I want to make a 10% Coffee grind hybrid cement mortar block, do I add 10% by weight or volume of Spent Coffee grind? Or is it closer to adding 12% Spent Coffee Grinds and then reducing the water 'raw ingredient' to accomodate for the moisture in the coffee grinds? <br><br>
          To eliminate this variability, I have read about drying the coffee to remove all moisture, but the next question is how dry is dry? How do I measure this? I have considered standardizing the drying process by prescribing a fixed duration of drying either in the sun (Again, unreliability in temperature and moisture in the environment) and oven baking. I am tending towards oven baking, with a first sample dried for a prescribed duration. YES, I know what you're thinking. "Anthony, how do you know what the starting moisture is in the Spent Coffee Grinds Sample? Won't this affect the final mositure content? How could you possibly control this?".<br><br>
          Very observant. To which I respond the process of drying will have to be sufficiently long enough to dry samples of all starting moistures, until they all reach 'bone dry' status. If that means a sample of low starting moisture reaches 'bone dry' within 15mins, whereas another more moist sample reaches 'bone dry' in 30mins, the drying process will be for a fixed duration of 30mins and low starting moisture samples will have to put up with the extra heat (without burning!).<br><br>
          The other variable introduced when considering the addition of coffee grinds is the source and associated composition. What is the composition of spent coffee grinds from, say, a UCT cafe, versus a local cafe, vs say home-sourced spent coffee grinds. Do the different sources have different compositions? How do we address this variability? In this regard my first thought is to collect from multiple sources, mix them together to create a homogenous benchmark, and just use that as an average outcome with regards to testing results. 
          
          <br><br><b>22/07/2022</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cement blocks (Cinder blocks for our Western readers) come in a variety of sizes, so to save myself some pain and suffering I have chosen one size (Don't call me lazy!). The 190cm x 190cm x 390cm is the most commonly used in South Africa, so for the sake of available data, comparability and eventual industry adoption, I have chosen this specification. They are typically rated 7Mpa strength, and so this is the critical number to aim for. Along with this, they sell (at the date of writing) for R+-14.80 ea. This is also an important factor to consider, as there is unfortunately little to gain from producing an eco-block that costs way more than it's non-green original. Oh! Maybe our green eco blocks should literally be green dyed? (Please contact me and persuade me otherwise 😂)<br><br>Basically, if we can get the same dimensions with similar mechanical properties at an equal or lower price, then all of this blabbering has not been wasted. Based on previous research the margin we can play around with for substituting sand with Coffee grinds is up to 20%. So in between 0% and 20% there is a sweet spot where we potentially have a green brick with acceptable mechanical properties and a reduced price to manufacture (remember the coffee grinds are freely available, whereas sand is typically paid for). In order to reduce the cost to manufacture the blocks should be produced in bulk, and by bulk I mean as many as I can physically make within the confines of my workshop and equipment.<br><br>Thereafter I will host the showdown of the century: Industry standard cement blocks VS Green Cubed blocks tested til failure in UCT's structural engineering lab (They don't know yet, it's a surprise). 
          <br><br>There is a lot of moving part to this plan, and it will be a while til we are ready to test and produce results. For one, I need to prepare a work area suitable for regular mixing, casting and curing of blocks. This includes making some sort of covered, consistently humid 'dry room' where blocks will be allowed to cure for... well as long as possible. Under other testing I understand lab results are obtained from 3, 7 and 28day cured samples, but because we are comparing and aiming to compete with existing industry blocks, we will assume a 28 day strength since the duration since manufacturing is unknown. At 28 days it is assumed samples have reached 99% strength, and can be compared both in a lab and with online data for typical 28 days strengths.
          <br><br>In creating a mould, I am still learning towards my original aforementioned design... Oh, look at that, you can buy cement block moulds? Who knew. Okay, now you can call me lazy. But I'm going to save some time and invest in a mould made by people who know (or hopefully know) what they're doing. That way I can spend time making prototypes, which is more important right?
